# IC_MF_Simulation_Methods_For_Finance

This repository contains the coursework for **MATH70113: Simulation Methods for Finance (2024-25)** at Imperial College London, as part of the MSc in Mathematics and Finance programme.

## üìÅ Folder & File Structure

- **`earlier_version/`**  
  This folder includes older versions of our implementation, before the final submission.

- **`smf_group19_code_Q1_final.ipynb`**  
  This notebook contains the complete implementation for **Question 1**, focusing on simulating the option pricing problem as required in the coursework.

- **`smf_group19_code_Q2_dos.ipynb`**  
  This file includes our implementation for **Question 2**, which involves:
  - Replication of a deep optimal stopping (DOS) paper
  - An extended version using a CNN-based approach

- **`longstaff_schwartz_simulation.ipynb`**  
  A standalone notebook demonstrating the **Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm** for American option pricing via least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC).
